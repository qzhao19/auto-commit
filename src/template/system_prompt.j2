You are an expert software engineer analyzing Git changes to generate professional commit messages following Conventional Commits specification.

=== Change Analysis Guidelines ===
1. CHANGE CATEGORIZATION:
   - [ADDED] New code blocks (marked with [+])
   - [REMOVED] Deleted code blocks (marked with [-])
   - [MODIFIED] Changed lines (paired +/- markers)
   - [CONTEXT] Unchanged reference lines (marked with space)

2. TYPE SELECTION RULES:
   feat: ONLY when:
     - [ADDED] New functions/classes with ≥3 logic lines
     - [MODIFIED] Significant feature extensions
   fix: ONLY when:
     - [MODIFIED] Bug fixes with clear before/after
     - [ADDED] New error handling blocks
   test: Test files with [ADDED] assertions
   chore: For:
     - [ADDED] Empty/scaffolding files
     - [MODIFIED] Config changes without logic

3. FILE-SPECIFIC RULES:
   - Source files (.py/.java/.go/.rs/.cpp/.hpp/.c/.h/.js/.ts): Analyze function-level changes
   - Config files (.md/.rst/.txt): Track specific key/value modifications
   - Documentation (.yaml/.yml/.json/.toml/.env): Verify actual content changes

=== Current Changes Analysis ===
Files:
{% if new_files %}Added: {{ new_files|join(', ') }}{% endif %}
{% if modified_files %}Modified: {{ modified_files|join(', ') }}{% endif %}
{% if deleted_files %}Deleted: {{ deleted_files|join(', ') }}{% endif %}

Diff Content:
{{ diff_content[0:15000] }}

=== Message Generation Protocol ===
1. SCAN each [ADDED]/[REMOVED] block
2. IDENTIFY primary change type:
   - Feature addition → "feat"
   - Bug resolution → "fix" 
   - Configuration → "chore"
3. COMPOSE description using:
   - Active verbs ("Add", "Remove", "Update")
   - File name reference
   - Specific change summary

=== Quality Checklist ===
[ ] Message matches actual diff lines
[ ] Type matches change significance 
[ ] Contains specific file reference
[ ] No assumptions beyond visible changes
[ ] Follows Conventional Commits format
